## 2017-08-30 修改以便在 ubuntu 下运行
1. 修改 `httpd.c` 代码风格，使用TAB(四个空格)进行缩进--------吐槽一下源代码使用一个空格进行缩进
2. 去掉 `Makefile` 里的 `-lsocket`, 将 `-lpthread` 改为 `-pthread`
3. 将 `htdocs` 中的 `check.cgi` 和 `color.cgi` 中的 `perl` 路径改为: `/usr/bin/perl`
4. 添加 `color.cgi` 的可执行权限，`chmod +x color.cgi`
5. 修改源码，去除了编译的警告

  If you use this software or examine the code, I would appreciate

if you use this software on your computer system.

  I wrote this webserver for an assignment in my networking class in
1999.  We were told that at a bare minimum the server had to serve
pages, and told that we would get extra credit for doing "extras."
Perl had introduced me to a whole lot of UNIX functionality (I learned
sockets and fork from Perl!), and O'Reilly's lion book on UNIX system
calls plus O'Reilly's books on CGI and writing web clients in Perl got
me thinking and I realized I could make my webserver support CGI with
little trouble.

  Now, if you're a member of the Apache core group, you might not be
impressed.  But my professor was blown over.  Try the color.cgi sample
script and type in "chartreuse."  Made me seem smarter than I am, at
any rate. :)

  Apache it's not.  But I do hope that this program is a good
educational tool for those interested in http/socket programming, as
well as UNIX system calls.  (There's some textbook uses of pipes,
environment variables, forks, and so on.)

  One last thing: if you look at my webserver or (are you out of
mind?!?) use it, I would just be overjoyed to hear about it.  Please
email me.  I probably won't really be releasing major updates, but if
I help you learn something, I'd love to know!

  Happy hacking!
